# SSMS_Project
This is a project I completed during my attendance at Ottawa University in a Database Management course. I wrote SQL and implemented it into the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Within this SSMS file, I have 3 or 4 separate databases that I used SQL to create and populate tables. I utilized an online SQL server to write and make sure the queries were successfully executed, then went on to input them in this Microsoft server.
