# SSMS_Project
This is a project I completed during my attendance at Ottawa University in a Database Management course. I wrote SQL and implemented it into the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Each file is a separate database design with its appropriate SQL.
I utilized an online SQL server to write and make sure the queries were successfully executed, then went on to input them into a Microsoft server later.
